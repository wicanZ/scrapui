                Scrap metal recycling is the process of recovering scrap metal from end-of-life products or structures and reusing it in the production of new metal products.

            <li>
                The scrap metal recycling process begins with sorting the scrap metal by type and grade. The most common grades are ferrous (iron and steel) and nonferrous (copper, aluminum, and stainless steel). Once sorted, the scrap metal is shredded or crushed into smaller pieces to make it easier to handle and process.

            <li>
                The next step in scrap metal recycling is separating the ferrous metal from the nonferrous metal. This is done using a magnet because ferrous metal is magnetic and nonferrous metal is not. The ferrous metal is then further separated into different grades using an eddy current separator, which uses magnets and electricity to separate metals based on their conductivity.

                The nonferrous metal is then separated into different grades using a gravity separator, which uses different weights and densities to separate metals.

            <li>
                Once the scrap metal is sorted and graded, it is ready to be sold to scrap metal dealers. Scrap metal dealers are businesses that buy scrap metal from individuals, businesses, and government entities and then sell it to metal recycling plants.

            <li>
                Metal recycling plants melt the metal and then use it to create new products. The most common products made from recycled scrap metal are steel beams, steel pipes, and steel sheets.

                The scrap metal recycling process helps to conserve natural resources, reduce pollution, and save energy.

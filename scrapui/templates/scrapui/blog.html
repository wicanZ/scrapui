                There's something oddly satisfying about taking a bunch of random junk and turning it into something useful. That's the appeal of scrap metal recycling.
                But it's not just about being eco-friendly (although that is a big part of it). Scrap metal recycling can actually be quite profitable.

                <p>
                    The key is to know what kinds of scrap metal are worth the most. Here's a quick guide:

            <li>
                Copper is by far the most valuable type of scrap metal. It's used in a ton of applications, so there's always a demand for it.
                Aluminum is also quite valuable. It's not quite as in-demand as copper, but it still fetches a decent price.

            </li>
            <li>
                Steel and iron are the least valuable types of scrap metal. They're not useless, but they're not worth as much as the other two.
            </li>
            <p>
                Now that you know what kinds of scrap metal are worth the most, you can start collecting it and selling it for a profit. Just be sure to check with your local recycling center for their specific prices.
